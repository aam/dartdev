/**
 * Instances of the class {@code Resolver} resolve references within the AST structure to the
 * elements being referenced. The requirements for the resolver are
 * <ul>
 * <li>Every {@link SimpleIdentifier} should be resolved to the element to which it refers.
 * Specifically:
 * <ul>
 * <li>An identifier within the declaration of that name should resolve to the element being
 * declared.</li>
 * <li>An identifier denoting a prefix should resolve to the element representing the prefix.</li>
 * <li>An identifier denoting a variable (including parameters) should resolve to the element
 * representing the variable.</li>
 * <li>An identifier denoting a field should resolve to the element representing the getter or
 * setter being invoked.</li>
 * <li>An identifier denoting the name of a method or function being invoked should resolve to the
 * element representing the method or function.</li>
 * <li>An identifier denoting a label should resolve to the element representing the label.</li>
 * </ul>
 * The identifiers within directives are exceptions to this rule and are covered below.</li>
 * <li>Every node containing a token representing an operator that can be overridden (
 * {@link BinaryExpression}, {@link PrefixExpression}, {@link PostfixExpression}) should resolve to
 * the element representing the method invoked by that operator.</li>
 * <li>Every node representing the invocation of a method or function, including unnamed functions,
 * should resolve to the element representing the method or function being invoked. This will be the
 * same element as that to which the name is resolved if the method or function has a name, but is
 * provided for those cases where an unnamed function is being invoked.</li>
 * <li>Every {@link LibraryDirective} and {@link PartOfDirective} should resolve to the element
 * representing the library being specified by the directive.</li>
 * <li>The {@link StringLiteral} representing the URI of a library in an {@link ImportDirective}
 * should resolve to the element representing the library being specified by the string.</li>
 * <li>The identifier representing the prefix in an {@link ImportDirective} should resolve to the
 * element representing the prefix.</li>
 * <li>The identifiers in the hide and show combinators in an {@link ImportDirective} should resolve
 * to the elements that are being hidden or shown, respectively.</li>
 * <li>The {@link StringLiteral} representing the URI of a part in a {@link PartDirective} should
 * resolve to the element representing the compilation unit being specified by the string.</li>
 * </ul>
 * Note that AST nodes that would represent elements that have not been defined are not resolved to
 * anything. This includes such things as references to undeclared variables (which is an error) and
 * names in a hide combinator that are not defined in the imported library (which is not an error).
